Twitter Thread: Social Scheduler CLI Launch

=== Tweet 1 ===
🚀 Introducing Social Scheduler CLI

A free social media scheduling tool that lives in your terminal.

No browser tabs. No $50/mo fees. Just:
$ sched post -c "Hello world!" -p twitter

📱 Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram
📅 Schedule posts in natural language
📄 Import from CSV

Why build another social media tool?

Because existing tools are:
❌ Complex dashboards
❌ Expensive for solos
❌ Browser-heavy
❌ Data-hungry

As a dev, I want:
simple commands that just work

That's what Social Scheduler delivers.

✨ Key Features:

🐦 Twitter/X with images/hashtags
💼 LinkedIn for professional content  
📸 Instagram photo scheduling
📅 Natural language ("in 2 hours")
📄 Bulk import from CSV
🆓 5 posts/week FREE

Works entirely in your terminal.

Quick example:

// Configure once
$ sched config --platform twitter

// Post now
$ sched post -c "Just launched!" -p twitter

// Schedule later
$ sched post -c "Follow-up" -p twitter,linkedin -s "tomorrow 9am"

// Import CSV batch
$ sched import content.csv

The CSV import is 🔥

Perfect for batching content:

```
content,platforms,scheduled_time
"Weekly update",twitter,monday 8am
"LinkedIn thought",linkedin,tuesday 9am
"Product photo",instagram,friday 5pm
```

Schedule a whole week in one file.

How does it work?

- Playwright for browser automation
- Local credential storage
- Zero external tracking
- Open source (MIT)

All your data stays on your machine.
No cloud. No Analytics. No BS.

=== FAQ Response Tweets ===

Q: Is this secure?
A: Credentials stored locally on your machine. We never see them. Next release adds optional encryption. Review the code - it's open source.

---

Q: Will I get banned?
A: This mimics manual browser actions at reasonable rates. Many users have been running it for months without issues. Always respect rate limits and platform guidelines.

---

Q: Can I try before buying premium?
A: Free tier includes 5 posts/week - more than enough to test everything. No credit card required.

---

Q: How is this different from API tools?
A: No API approval needed, no rate limits on reads, no business verification. Works immediately with any account.
